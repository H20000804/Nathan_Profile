This is my start of Github. Let's study together!
I've been hunting jobs about application development and algorithm for half month, but I just got 1 offer which is not good enough.
It's kind of frustrating. Finding a job in China is hard, even if I had finished my master course.
Anyway, I will keep strugling.
